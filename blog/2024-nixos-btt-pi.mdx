title: Installing NixOS on BTT PI

BigTreeTech Pi is a special-purpose board that is similar to Orange Pi zero2 (it
has the Allwinner H616), but built for 3d printers. I'll be using it for a
3d printer, but I also wanted to use
nixos to manage it. This is what I tried to get it to work. Ultimately, I gave (for now?).
So if you're looking for how to get it running, the princess is in another castle. Sorry.

## First attempt

First I tried to use normal nixos firmware from [NixOS on ARM wiki page](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/NixOS_on_ARM#Installation).

```sh
sudo dd if=/path/to/nixos-sd-image-....img of=/dev/sdX status=progress
```

This obviously did not work. Since I couldn't find a good documented way of building
a custom image with u-boot I gave up after some short experimentation. This is
what you get for using weird SBCs...

Next, I tried the image from [katyo/nixos-arm](https://github.com/katyo/nixos-arm)
which did not work either.

## Custom u-boot

```nix
# flake.nix
{
  description = "U-Boot stuffs";
  inputs.nixpkgs.url = "github:nixos/nixpkgs/nixos-23.11";
  outputs = inputs:
    with (import inputs.nixpkgs {
      system = "aarch64-linux";
    }); {
      devShells.aarch64-linux.default = mkShell {
        buildInputs = [
          gnumake
          gcc
          bison
          flex
          (python3.withPackages (ps: with ps; [setuptools]))
          swig
          openssl_3_1
          ncurses
          dtc
        ];
      };
    };
}
```

```sh
nix develop # dependencies

git clone https://github.com/ARM-software/arm-trusted-firmware.git
cd arm-trusted-firmware
git checkout 57410eebe697546e4d66f5b70acbc68131b28cb1
make PLAT=sun50i_h616 DEBUG=1 bl31
cd ..

export SCP=/dev/null # I don't need suspend
export BL31=$PWD/arm-trusted-firmware/build/sun50i_h616/debug/bl31.bin
git clone git://git.denx.de/u-boot.git
cd u-boot
git checkout v2024.01
make orangepi_zero2_defconfig
make
```

U-boot's `board/sunxi/README.sunxi64` might be of interest to you.

What I think is the reason for those attempts not working is that BTT Pi is not
close enough to the Orange Pi Zero2 for the configs to work. But since I do not
know if my attempts work on orange pi, I decided to scrap it and try something
different. I might revisit this approach if at some point I'm trying to setup
some next SBC and then I might have enough experience to get it working on this
weird board...

## Plan C: kexec

Plan C: [nixos-anywhere](https://nix-community.github.io/nixos-anywhere/quickstart.html).

First, I flashed the oficial minimal image:

```
sudo dd if=.../CB1_Debian11_minimal_kernel5.16_20230712.img of=/dev/sda status=progress bs=1M oflag=direct,sync
```

then I kexec'd nixos

```
curl -L https://github.com/nix-community/nixos-images/releases/download/nixos-unstable/nixos-kexec-installer-noninteractive-aarch64-linux.tar.gz | tar -xzf- -C /root
```

That did not work. I don't know why, but it might be because they call for 1.5G
of RAM and this board only has 1. Oh well.

## Conclusion

I learned a bit, but ultimately failed. Next time I'll be getting a *board* that
has better mainline support. I naively thought if a SOC has good support and I
don't need any extra SBC stuffs it'll work. Well, I was wrong. To my defense,
this one was included in the kit of the printer.

It still works with the included armbian-based? image, so at least it's not going
to the bin.
