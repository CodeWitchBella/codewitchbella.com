title: Converting UTC into specific timezone in PostgreSQL

Before I start: if you can, avoid this, transmit your dates in [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601)
and only format it at the last moment possible. If you have to do time math,
read on.

**tl;dr:**

```sql
select
    table.timestamp::timestamptz at time zone 'America/New_York' as timestamp_et
from table;
```

The `::timestamptz` converts it from `timestamp` to `timestamptz` type. If your
column is already of this type, you can remove it. Note that `timestamptz` is
horribly mis-named. It does not, as you might expect, store timestamp+timezone,
instead it's "timestamp in current timezone" instead of "timestamp in unknown
timezone". Why would you ever want to store either of these? Beats me.

The `at time zone '...'` portion converts it from current timezone into the
specified timezone. Again, since postgres does not have a type that stores
"timestamp+timezone", the result is `timestamp without time zone` or timestamp
in unknown timezone. You can check that with `pg_typeof`.

## Miscalenous ramblings

Now that the cookbook-style section is over, here are some miscelaneous things
I would very much not like to have to remember, but are unfortunatelly important.

What is the current timezone? You can find out by running `SHOW TIMEZONE;`. My
database thankfully is in UTC (the `Etc/UTC` timezone), so I'm safe. If your
database is in some other timezone, I'd like to extend my sincere condolences.

Can I change my local timezone? Yes, with `SET timezone TO 'Europe/Prague'`.
What this does, is if you have `timestamptz` it will get printed in this timezone.
Also, if you convert `timestamp` into `timestamptz` it'll use this timezone.
This is because this conversion does not actually do anything, because `timestamptz`
does not store the timezone at all.

What if my timestamps are in different timezone than the current timezone? Well,
then you use `timestamp at timezone '...'`. Yes, that's is the same syntax as
converting from `timestamptz` to `timestamp`, but does the conversion in other
direction. Anyway, the best way here is to just check if the output is what you
expect as it depends on the types of your columns.

*Warning:* Only ever use named timezones. They correctly handle daylight saving
times, offset changes and other fun things. Also, ISO 8601 and POSIX don't agree
on which direction is positive and which is negative. Posix is positive to west,
ISO 8601 is positive to east. Yes, it's cursed.

*Final tip:* always test your code with positive offsets and negative offsets. Eg.
with `America/New_York` and `Europe/Prague`. It will reveal bugs where you are
just truncating UTC timestamps instead of converting to correct day.

## Summary

All in all, it's not *too* bad as long as you realize that `timezone` and
`timezonetz` are basically used in the oposite circumstances than you'd expect.
The `tz` variant should be default you reach for when handling data in `UTC` (as
long as that is your default). The plain variant is used when you want to convert
that into some other timezone (eg. when you want to aggregate by date).
