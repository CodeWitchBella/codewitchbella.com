Today I found [Lezer](https://lezer.codemirror.net/), thought it was cool and
used it for a project. As such, I started writing a blog post that was explaining
how it works before knowledge of it exits my brain. Well, that did not go as planned.
Instead I created a playground which allows you to edit Lezer grammar and see
how it applies to a given snippet of code. Maybe some day I'll finish the original
blog post. In the mean time, enjoy the playground ðŸ˜‰

If you found it useful, feel free to ping me on [mastodon](https://tech.lgbt/@isbl).

Colors in example higlighting are borrowed from [sashamaps.net](https://sashamaps.net/docs/resources/20-colors/).

If you are colorblind, I'm terribly sorry and hope this tool is of any use to you.
Feel free to reach out and we might be able to figure out a solution that works
for you. I have a few ideas on how to address the issue, but would like to have
some feedback from someone who actually is colorblind.
