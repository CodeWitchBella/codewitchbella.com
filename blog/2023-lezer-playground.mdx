Today I found [Lezer](https://lezer.codemirror.net/), thought it was cool and
used it for a project. As such, I started writing a blog post that was explaining
how it works before knowledge of it exits my brain. Well, that did not go as planned.
Instead I created a playground which allows you to edit Lezer grammar and see
how it applies to a given snippet of code. Maybe some day I'll finish the original
blog post. In the mean time, enjoy the playground ðŸ˜‰
