title: The case against TitleCase

When it comes to many contentious conventions in programming languages I'm
personally for "pick one and stick to it" kind of solution. Ideally followed by
enforcing the convention via some kind of static linter. Filenames are diffent.

Unless your whole team is only on linux, then you should choose naming convention
which dictates only lowercase filenames. Why? Because if you pick something like
`FileName.ext`, then inevitable there will be the one dev who: names the file
`fileName.ext`, renames it to `FileName.ext` and commits the result. What is the
problem? Well, if they are on windows (and maybe macos) then depending on what
interface they used for renaming the file, there is a chance that the file will
be named `fileName.ext` in git, which will cause the CI to fail (I hope you have
a CI). And most problematically: they might not be able to fix the problem.

Therefore, in every project I set the standards for, or have influence over, I
advocate for `kebab-case.ext` (in case of javascript/typescript) or `snake_case.ext`
file names[^fn]. However, if someone else wrote the
project and I'm now maintaining it, I'd have to rename all the files and update
all the imports. That gets tedious really quick and is easy to get wrong.

[^fn]: Unless the language has strong naming convention, prefer those over random
  blog posts.

## Automatic renaming

In case you find yourself in my situation of having a project written in typescript
which follows the `TitleCase.ext` convention, you might find the following script
useful. Please make sure
that you have something which will check the result (like a bundler or typescript)
and that you committed the previous state,
because this is not a well-tested piece of code. I only know it worked on that
one codebase I wrote it for.


```js
// filename: kebabify.mjs
import fs from 'node:fs'
import path from 'node:path'

// replace with your directory
traverse('src')

function traverse(dir) {
  const files = fs.readdirSync(dir, { withFileTypes: true })
  for (const file of files) {
    const k = kebab(file.name)
    if (k !== file.name) {
      fs.renameSync(path.join(dir, file.name), path.join(dir, k))
    }
    if (file.isDirectory()) {
      traverse(path.join(dir, k))
    } else {
      const contents = fs.readFileSync(path.join(dir, k), 'utf-8')
      const changed = patch(contents)
      if (contents !== changed) {
        fs.writeFileSync(path.join(dir, k), changed)
      }
    }
  }
}

function patch(src) {
  // if you have some alias pointing to the source replace [.] with eg. [.~]
  return src.replace(/from '[.]([^']+)'/g, v => {
    return kebab(v).replace(/\/-/g, '/')
  })
}

function kebab(src) {
  return src.replace(/([A-Z])/g, (m) => `-${m.toLowerCase()}`).replace(/^-/,'')
}
```

Note that the above code does not update dynamic imports as the codebase had few
enough of those to update by hand.

Also note that you'll probably want to go and rename files which started as
`ExportPDF` and became `export-p-d-f` to `export-pdf`.
