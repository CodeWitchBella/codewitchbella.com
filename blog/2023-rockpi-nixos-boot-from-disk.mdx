In [previous](/blog/2023-nixos-rockpi-4c) [posts](/blog/2023-nixos-anywhere-rockpi-4c)
I got nixos working on my RockPI 4C. One thing that did not sit right was that
it required everything on the system to be on either the eMMC or SD card. I have
a ssd connected to thing after all.

Anyway, the reason for this is that the system packaged into initramfs (that's
the stuff nixos puts in the [ESP](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/EFI_system_partition))
needs to be able to mount certain paths on the system.[^fn]

[^fn]: Those paths are `/`, `/nix`, `/nix/store`, `/var`, `/var/log`, `/var/lib`,
`/var/lib/nixos`, `/etc`, `/usr`. You can get this list by looking at docs
of [virtualisation.fileSystems.\<name\>.neededForBoot](https://search.nixos.org/options?show=virtualisation.fileSystems.%3Cname%3E.neededForBoot).

This should work automatically, but in my case, the system needs some extra
kernel modules to be able to reach the SSD. I have my ssd installed in the
[Penta SATA HAT](https://wiki.radxa.com/Penta_SATA_HAT), but I'd expect the same
modules to be needed for other options as well. The magic incantation to make it
work is:

```nix
  boot.initrd.availableKernelModules = [
    "phy_rockchip_pcie"
    "pcie_rockchip_host"
  ];
```

How do you get this list you might ask? Well, since I know that the disks are
working on my running system, I know the list of suspected kernel modules.
Just run the `lsmod` command. This outputs a list of 115 modules.

I can narrow this down a little by excluding modules that are a dependency of
other modules as that will be included by the dependant module (see the Used by
column). This gets us down to 57 modules. Now we can test which modules are
needed and which are not. What I did was input the list of all modules first and
confirm that it boots.

After I was in known-working state, I deleted some modules and tried rebooting.
Good thing here is that if it did not work, I could just select older generation
and I was back in working state again. When a deletion caused the system to no
longer boot, I knew that I removed important module. In reality since it was more
convenient to test with working boot, I prefered modules which I suspected are
not needed first, but in principle it could be done even without that.

And that's it, I now have a working nixos-based rockpi4c including ssd support.
I can't really imagine how painful it'd be with a distro which does not offer
declarative configuration which could be deployed remotely.
