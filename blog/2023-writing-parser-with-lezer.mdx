In this blog post I'll try to give a short introduction on the lezer parser
language. It also contains interactive playground, which I think might be useful
for exploring the language.

I have a [songbook](https://zpevnik.skorepova.info/) web application which, among
other things, functions as a songbook. That means that it stores songs which it
can display. The app started life 5 years ago as school project which was a web
rewrite of previous project in LaTeX. The core song format stayed backward-compatible
without a major rewrite since then and I also added some features.

All of that is to say: the song format is weird. The current parser for it is
270 lines of javascript which is not particularly nice. At the same time, there
is an editor component which uses [Monaco](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/)
editor and has some basic syntax highlighting. Since the current configuration
of Monaco weighs in at about 8MiBs[^1] I wanted to either slim it down or replace it.
Another problem with Monaco is that is made for desktop and does not play nice
with browsers on phones.[^2]

Enter [CodeMirror 6](https://codemirror.net/), which has all the features I need
but is smaller and works on phones. The trouble here is that I have to port my
syntax highlighting logic to it. CodeMirror has multiple ways to achieve this,
but I decided to go with the hard mode and write a parser with lezer. It does not
have to support the full language but it should support enough so that syntax
highlighting works.

## Lezer introduction

Lezer has a pretty [nice documentation](https://lezer.codemirror.net/), but in
a nutshell it's a parser system with it's own grammar language. From this grammar
you then generate javascript code. This javascript code can then parse the language
you defined and once you define some mappings, CodeMirror can syntax highlight
your language ðŸŽ‰

The gist is that you defined tokens (which are raw string sequences) and nodes,
which can in turn consist of tokens, or nodes. But before we get to that, let's
introduce the basics of the language on an example:

<pre><code className="hljs"><span className="text-green-300 font-black">S:</span> When <span className="text-blue-300 font-semibold">[C]</span>the days are cold, And <span className="text-blue-300 font-semibold">[G]</span>the cards all fold
And <span className="text-blue-300 font-semibold">[Ami]</span>the saints we see, Are <span className="text-blue-300 font-semibold">[F]</span>all made of gold
When <span className="text-blue-300 font-semibold">[C]</span>your dreams all fail, And <span className="text-blue-300 font-semibold">[G]</span>the ones we hail
Are <span className="text-blue-300 font-semibold">[Ami]</span>the worst of all, And <span className="text-blue-300 font-semibold">[F]</span>the bloodâ€™s run stale</code></pre>

Here you can see two features of the language: `S:` which introduces a verse section
and `[Chord]` which denotes a chord. Here's what the grammar for that looks like:

[^1]: This is actually not as big of a problem as it might first seem. There are
multiple things that make this more manageable. First is that the app is well
code-split, so the initial load only loads in what you actually need. The second
is that the app is fully offline-enabled so unless I release an update, you will
never have to redownload that code. But it is still better to not have my app be
twice as large as it needs to be.

[^2]: I fix typos on my phone. To be able to do this I introduced a toggle which
replaces the nice editor with syntax highlighting with plain textarea. This works
but it'd be nice to make it work so that I can remove this toggle.
