title: Use GitHub token to clone private repositories in CI via HTTPS

tl;dr: You can use yarn to install github repositories, even if the repository
is private and you are using GitHub Actions as your CI.

We have a private repository on GitHub that contains specification for our API.
One of the goals of this effort was to generate typescript types so that the
frontend team does not have to duplicate every endpoint specification in types.
The question is how to pull this code into the frontend repo.

The original proposal for this called for using git subtree. This is fine, but
requires a bit of advanced knowledge of git to be able to update this. What if
we could use something that every frontend dev is familiar with to pull the
dependency: npm? The obvious way to do this would be to push the versions to npm,
but that would add considerable complications to the CI of the specs repo. Then
it occured to me: npm (and yarn, which is what we actually use) can install
dependencies from GitHub. Now the question becomes: how do we authenticate the
clone process when it installs?

Fortunatelly, it seems that modern yarn uses normal `git clone` to clone repository
first, then it packs it using `yarn pack` and then it installs the resulting
tarball. This even allows us to have a build step in the process (to convert
typescript to .d.ts and .js files bunlers expect to have in node_modules).
On dev machines it therefore Just Works™️ as devs have SSH keys setup, which do
have access to the appropriate repository.

The other part of the equation was GitHub Actions. Those do have by default only
access to the repository that triggered them. We already had a github token setup
for other purposes, so this is not a big problem, but the question was: how do
we inject this correctly so that git has access to it when yarn invokes it.
Without furhter ado, here is the code

```bash
# create file which specifies the token
echo "https://git:${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}@github.com" > ${RUNNER_TEMP}/git-credentials.store
# set git to look for the file
git config --global credential.helper 'store --file ${RUNNER_TEMP}/git-credentials.store'
# install dependencies
yarn --immutable
# delete the file
rm -f ${RUNNER_TEMP}/git-credentials.store
```

One last consideration is that the last step should always run even if installation
fails, so the actual github actions setup looks like this (it's a part of composite
github action):

```yaml
- name: Install
  shell: bash
  run: |
    set -xe
    mkdir -p ${RUNNER_TEMP}
    git config --global credential.helper 'store --file ${RUNNER_TEMP}/git-credentials.store'
    echo "https://git:${{ inputs.token }}@github.com" > ${RUNNER_TEMP}/git-credentials.store
    yarn --immutable
- name: Cleanup
  shell: bash
  if: always()
  run: rm -f ${RUNNER_TEMP}/git-credentials.store
```
