If you ever find yourself wanting to clone a private github repository via HTTPS
by using GitHub token, you landed in the right place. But first, ask yourself if
this is truly something you want and consider alternative solutions as this probably
will only work on your machine and in CI, not on other devs machines (speaking
from experience here). But if you still want to do this (I ended up choosing
an alternative solution), here's how.

Without furhter ado, here is the code

```bash
# create file which specifies the token
echo "https://git:${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}@github.com" > ${RUNNER_TEMP}/git-credentials.store
# set git to look for the file
git config --global credential.helper 'store --file ${RUNNER_TEMP}/git-credentials.store'
# install dependencies
yarn --immutable
# delete the file
rm -f ${RUNNER_TEMP}/git-credentials.store
```

Since you are probably doing this in CI, please also make sure that you clean the
store once you're done â€” even if the next step fails. Here's how to do that in
github actions

```yaml
- name: Install
  shell: bash
  run: |
    set -xe
    mkdir -p ${{ runner.temp }}
    git config --global credential.helper 'store --file ${{ runner.temp }}/git-credentials.store'
    echo "https://git:${{ inputs.token }}@github.com" > ${{ runner.temp }}/git-credentials.store
    # Use your newly gained access here
- name: Cleanup
  shell: bash
  if: always()
  run: rm -f ${{ runner.temp }}/git-credentials.store
```

The way this works is we set [git-credential-store](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-credential-store)
as git credential helper. It's a program which provides git with credentials for
accessing resources, which is exactly what we want here. It allows you to specify
file for loading the data.

Lastly, if you want to used this in Dockerfile, use [<code>--mount=type=secret</code>](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#run---mounttypesecret)
to give docker access to your file without saving it to the build history.
